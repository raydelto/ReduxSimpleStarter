# ReduxSimpleStarter

This is the fork of the ReduxSimpleStarter created by Raydelto Hernandez.

Here I'm posting my complete code , which you can see running at http://youtube.raydelto.org/ .

Below you can find all the information on the project and the Udemy course written by its creator. It's a very well structured course.  I highly recommend it.
